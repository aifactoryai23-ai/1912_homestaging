Simply upload a picture of your outdoor area, select the Outdoor design mode, and HomeDesignPro will generate a new landscape design with plants, flowers, trees, garden paths and seating areas.\n\nThe AI outdoor designer helps you visualize backyard makeovers, terrace and patio designs, or small garden ideas before you spend money on real plants and materials."

Virtually staged properties sell up to 87% faster and for around 15% higher prices compared to vacant homes. On average, that can mean about $70,000 more for the seller, or roughly $3,500 in extra commission for the real estate agent per deal.\n\nAn agent who sells around 10 properties per year can earn up to $35,000 in additional income using virtual staging. With HomeDesignPro’s Pro plan, you can create up to 1,000 virtually staged rooms per month using the Virtual Staging AI feature for only $299 per year, making it a cost-effective tool to improve listing photos and increase conversions."

Our AI analyzes the space, layout and lighting and then, in about 15 seconds, generates photorealistic images of a redesigned interior based on your preferences.\n\nYou can use the service from any laptop, tablet or phone and get professional-looking design ideas without hiring a traditional interior designer for thousands of dollars. After signing up, you unlock the HomeDesignPro AI Studio with 30+ room types and 50+ interior design styles."

      {
        "id": "design-modes",
        "question": "How do the different HomeDesignPro AI design modes work?",
        "answer": "HomeDesignPro AI offers several design modes, each optimized for a different use case:\n\n- Interior Design with 3D Vision – Keeps the existing structure of your room (walls, windows, main furniture) and mainly changes style, colors and decor. Ideal for realistic \"before and after\" previews.\n- Interior Design (2D Photo) – Similar to the 3D mode, but allows the AI to manipulate the space more freely. It can change furniture placement and some elements of the layout.\n- Virtual Staging AI – Built for filling empty rooms with furniture. Perfect for real-estate listings, Airbnb hosts and property developers who need quick virtual staging.\n- Freestyle – Does not require an input photo. The AI generates interior concepts from scratch using only the room type and style you choose.\n- Sketch2Image – Converts your hand-drawn or digital interior sketches into detailed, photorealistic renderings.\n- SketchUp Mode – Upload a screenshot from your SketchUp model and the AI transforms it into a high-quality, realistic interior render."

      {
        "id": "virtual-staging",
        "question": "Can I virtually stage properties with HomeDesignPro AI?",
        "answer": "Yes. HomeDesignPro AI includes a dedicated Virtual Staging AI mode for real-estate virtual staging and empty room visualization.\n\nUpload a photo of an unfurnished or partially furnished space, select the room type and desired interior style, then choose Virtual Staging AI in the Mode dropdown and click Create. The system will keep the existing architecture (walls, windows, flooring) and automatically add appropriate furniture, decor and lighting."

        "id": "payment-not-accepted",
        "question": "Why is my payment method not accepted when I sign up?",
        "answer": "If your payment is being declined when subscribing to HomeDesignPro AI, it is usually due to security checks. Try the following:\n\n1. Disable any VPN or proxy you’re using and try again.\n2. Make sure the cardholder name, CVC/CVV code and postal/ZIP code exactly match the details registered with your bank.\n3. Your card country must match your billing country.\n4. Ensure that 3D Secure (or a similar authentication method) is enabled with your bank and complete any verification steps that appear.\n\nThese measures help us prevent fraud and keep all users’ payments secure."
      },
      {
        "id": "photo-types",
        "question": "What type of photos should I upload of my current interior?",
        "answer": "For the best AI interior design results, follow these photo guidelines:\n\n- Take photos from a straight-on angle, facing a main wall, window or focal point of the room.\n- Avoid extreme angles or very low/high shots – angled photos can work, but straight photos usually produce much higher-quality designs.\n- Ensure the image is sharp, in focus and well lit (natural daylight works best).\n- Try to capture the whole room or at least a large portion of it, not just close-ups of furniture.\n\nThe better your input photo, the more accurate and realistic the HomeDesignPro AI render will be."

        "question": "Who built HomeDesignPro AI and who is behind the project?",
        "answer": "HomeDesignPro AI was created by ALEKSANDRE MAKHARADZE, an ML engineer and entrepreneur. The platform is built and maintained independently, without a large corporate team – just ALEKSANDRE working from his laptop, supported by a lot of AI automation running behind the scenes."
      },
      {
        "id": "match-current-interior",
        "question": "How closely will the AI redesign match my real home and construction?",
        "answer": "How accurately HomeDesignPro AI matches your real interior depends mainly on:\n\n1. Photo quality – Clear, high-resolution photos with good lighting help the AI understand your room’s proportions, materials and layout.\n2. Chosen design mode – Some modes are more experimental, while others are optimized for realism.\n\nFor example:\n- The Creative mode (where available) will give you bolder, more imaginative ideas that may not strictly follow your actual construction.\n- Interior Design with 3D Vision sticks very closely to your existing architectural structure and main elements, updating mostly the style, color scheme and decor.\n\nWe are continuously improving our models so that AI room makeovers become more precise and realistic over time."
      },
      {
        "id": "artifacts",
        "question": "Will my AI interior designs contain artefacts or visual glitches?",
        "answer": "Sometimes, yes. Any app using generative AI image technology can produce visual artefacts. Depending on the input photo and design mode, you might occasionally see:\n\n- Furniture with odd proportions (e.g. chairs with too few legs).\n- Small inconsistencies in shadows or reflections.\n- Minor construction details that don’t fully match reality.\n\nFrom our experience, roughly 90% of renders are good enough for practical use, and about 10% turn out exceptionally well.\n\nHomeDesignPro AI also includes a built-in editor that lets you brush out artefacts and regenerate specific areas of the image. We’re constantly working on reducing artefacts further, for example by automatically detecting them and re-rendering parts of the image. Still, the system isn’t perfect yet, and we don’t claim it is."

        "id": "payment-secure",

        "answer": "Yes. HomeDesignPro AI uses BOG and Tochka – both leading regional financial institutions – for all financial transactions.\n\nWe never store your full card details on our own servers.\nThese banks provide bank-level encryption and security standards.\nAll card data is handled and processed directly by the banks in accordance with strict industry regulations (such as PCI DSS).\n\nThis setup helps keep your payments safe and your billing data protected."

      },
      {
        "id": "refund",
        "question": "Can I get a refund?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, we are not able to offer refunds. Generating AI images requires significant GPU computing power, and those infrastructure costs are paid per use. Our upstream providers do not refund us for processing time, which means issuing refunds would make the service unsustainable.\n\nWhen you sign up and start using HomeDesignPro AI, you agree to waive your standard right to refund in exchange for immediate access to the product and its AI generation features."
